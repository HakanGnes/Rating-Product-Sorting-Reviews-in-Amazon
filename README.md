# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

## Business Problem
One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the scores given to products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, making the product stand out for sellers, and a smooth shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Highlighting misleading comments will directly affect the sales of the product, causing both financial and customer loss. By solving these 2 basic problems, e-commerce sites and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.
